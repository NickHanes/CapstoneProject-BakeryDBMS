Hello!

This is my capstone project.  I wanted to make something that was for my mom's new bakery, Sweeter Side Bakeshop, and made her life 10x easier.  I made an inventory 
management system that would keep track of ingredients ordered and used, as well as inventory alerts for low stock.  

1. To make this a reality, I had to connect to Square's API to retrieve order information and how many products each customers get.
2. I encrypted this data using PHP and connected this PHP directly to SQLite.
3. I set up a HTML / CSS page that implements Node.js to provide a UI that can easily be used by my mom.
4. Finally, I committed everything to GitHub to allow for my mom to download the database, HTML, and all necessary tools needed to use the system.

That's it!  Enjoy the DBMS and thank you for taking the time to view it.
