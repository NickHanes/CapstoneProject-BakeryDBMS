Hello!

This is my capstone project.  I wanted to make something that was for my mom's new bakery, Sweeter Side Bakeshop, and made her life 10x easier.  I made an inventory 
management system that would keep track of ingredients ordered and used, as well as inventory alerts for low stock.  

1. To make this a reality, I had to enter in all recipes, ingredients, and products that she uses/has
2. I used Python to code the backend, Uvicorn to run my app, and Postgres to store my data
3. I set up a HTML / CSS page that implements Node.js to provide a UI that can easily be used by my mom.
4. Finally, I used Tailscale to allow my mom to use the JS wherever I am and wherever she is and still have the database stored locally.

That's it!  Enjoy the DBMS and thank you for taking the time to view it.
